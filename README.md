# binmerge-gui

Disc images are sometimes presented with a single .cue file followed
by multiple .bin/.wav files. While this is usually a normal feature of
disc ripping software, sometimes it can be hard to work with multiple
track files, or needlessly difficult to try to split a single-file
image.

To address some nuances on managing such images, you can use this tool
to merge different tracks into a single cue/bin file. You can also
revert the process and split the tracks.
